## Intent
Lock-Manager design pattern is used to allow
for the management of locks by reference as opposed to an instance.

## Class diagram
![alt text](./etc/lazy-loading.png "Lazy Loading")

## Applicability
Use the Lock-Manager design pattern when:

* there is a requirement for a centralization of lock information.
* there is a requirement for the storage of objects externally.
